# Calculating DNA Sequence Entropy for Phylogenetic Analysis of SNP and STR regions

This is a small project I did for my final year thesis back in 2017-2018. The idea was to find markers of short tandem repeats (STRs, or microsatellites) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on  Shannon entropy applied to DNA sequences. The code was heavily inspired by a wonderful C++ library [lobSTR](https://github.com/mgymrek/lobstr-code). 

My thesis (in Russian) is stored in  /thesis. The code is stored in /scripts.  The comments in this project's code are in Russian too. Some of the data used for the project is in /data.

The code here is purely for archiving and demonstration purposes.
